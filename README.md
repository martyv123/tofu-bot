# Tofu Discord Bot

The purpose of this bot is to automate some of the processes on my Discord server as well as my friends' servers.
The bot features moderation commands as well as some fun commands based on our friend group.
These commands make it easier for my server's admin team to moderate our chat and channels. 
Currently this bot is hosted on Heroku so that it is available 24/7 for users in my server. 
Future commands will include more utility commands, such as functions to play music and games
within the chat.

## Current commands

### Moderation
!kick @user "reason <br>
!ban @user "reason" <br>
!unban @user "reason" <br>
!mute @user "reason" <br>
!unmute @user "reason" <br>
